            2004 as the first troupe on campus to offer both long- and short-form improv comedy. Since then, we have
            performed at campuses and theaters across the US. Fuzzy Dice is both an improv
            group and a family, which makes it that much easier for us to enjoy doing what we love.</font>

              <p>Shivani Sahu is a four-time EGOT winner/SoundCloud rapper from super super duper duper duper far away
                in New Jersey. But like really far New Jersey. Like. Super. Far. She initially joined Fuzzy Dice to
                distract from the fact that she is actually two kids in a trench coat. On a good day, she is 5'2", but
                on a really good day she is 7'6". This is when she is three kids in a trench coat. When she is not
                making a pained expression while eating waffles messily, she is actively recruiting the fourth kid in a
                trench coat. Applications currently being accepted. Thank you in advance.</p>

                rational person from LA will tell you that he is not. If not fulfilling every California stereotype, you
                will often find him spontaneously dancing to nothing in particular or attempting to bring back the
                mid-Atlantic accent and infuse the word "innit" into American English. If you quote any lines from
                Pixar's <i>Up</i> or NBC's <i>Community</i>, he is contractually obligated to love you unconditionally
                forever.</p>

                deeply-rooted fear of crustaceans unless they're cooked. When asked how he stays so positve, he answers,

                super chill. When submerged underwater he can be found to unexplainably grow three quarters of an inch.

                ended up in the US through a comedy of increasingly unbelievable errors (see autobiography for full

                procrastinating and forgetting almost everything all the time. They can easily be identified by their
                bright pink bicycle helmet, some form of tartan clothing or by loud mysterious crashing noises in the
                distance that everyone should totally split up to go investigate.</p>

                would always be down to eat a pizza! Back in his home state which has the Pizza capital of the world
                (New Haven) he ate 3 Zuppardi's pizzas in 1 hour and was carried in his chair like they do for Bar
